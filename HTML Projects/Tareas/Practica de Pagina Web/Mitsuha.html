        <p>
            <b>Mitsuha Miyamizu</b> <i>(宮水 三葉 Miyamizu Mitsuha)</i> is a 17-year-old teenager who lives in a small rural town called Itomori. 
            She is part of her family's shrine and participates in old traditions by being a shrine maiden with her younger sister. 
            Dislike of his hometown, problems with his family's sanctuary, and problems with his father make Mitsuha want to live 
            as a handsome boy in Tokyo. Her wish would eventually be partially granted, as she would begin to switch bodies 
            with <b>Taki Tachibana</b>. <br>
