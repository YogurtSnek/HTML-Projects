        Hello, my name is <i>Johan Gurrola</i> and this webpage was made for a homework assignment and to promote the film Kimi no Na wa, otherwise known as, Your name. <br>
        I had to turn it in late due to some time constraints with some school work but I am satisfied by how it turned out. <br>
        Please be feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:a20490703@itmexicali.edu.mx">a20490703@itmexicali.edu.mx</a> if you have further inquiries.
